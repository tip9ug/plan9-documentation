Welcome to the Plan 9 Documentation Project!
============================================

## Introduction

In general, Plan9 is considered beyond the average computer user's knowledge. We want to improve Plan 9 documentation for entry-level users. Plan 9 mastery begins at mastering the basics. It is the project's intention to create clear and concise documentation to promote Plan 9 use and enjoyment.
